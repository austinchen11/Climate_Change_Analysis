# Proposal

## Research topic
Climate change is commonly referred to as the long term change in Earth's climate and weather patterns, and although these changes may be naturally occurring, since the 1800s, artificial human activities have been the main driver.  Throughout the scientific community, climate change is no longer considered to be a "future" issue, in fact, changes to Earth's climate driven by the increased emissions of fossil fuels are already having widespread effects on the environment: rising global temperatures, shrinking ice sheets and glaciers, rising sea levels, depleting ozone, and extreme weather events such as droughts, heatwaves, and excessive rainfall.  Most, if not all of these changes can be attributed to quantifiable human factors, therefore, our project - Climate Change Analysis - seeks to explore and visualize these relationships.  For example, by examining time series data (by country) on atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, mean temperature change, mean sea level change, energy consumption, air pollution ...etc, we are hopefully able to gain some valuable insights on what each individual country's "contribution" to climate change is.  Furthermore, by bringing in additional data such as the population, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and other characteristics of those same countries, a more significant relationship can potentially be realized.  Understanding that much of the world has been plagued by a global pandemic during the last couple of years (which undoubtedly affects human activity), we also seek to compare metrics such as air pollution before and during COVID-19.  Lastly, with the adoption of the Paris Agreement, focusing on climate change adaptation and finance, in 2015, we are interesting in seeing which countries actually implemented the proposed strategies to mitigate their climate contributions.  

## Data availability

With climate change being such a forefront issue in the world today, there are vast amounts of data available on this subject, from a multitude of sources such as NASA, NOAA, and other climate organizations around the world.  Therefore, our group is planning to combine multiple data sets to output a more comprehensive analysis.  The following sections will denote the data sets we plan on using, as well as any relevant information regarding the data source and data collection process.  

### Annual Surface Temperature Change

https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/ET 

This data set showcases the annual estimates of mean surface temperature change from 1961 to 2021 by country, with respect to a baseline climatology (defined as the period of 1951 to 1980).  The data comes from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and is updated annualy, as it is a yearly time series data.  The data is downloadable as a csv file, which can easily be read into R Studios.

### Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Concentrations

https://climatedata.imf.org/datasets/9c3764c0efcc4c71934ab3988f219e0e/explore 
https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/ 

This data set showcases the monthly atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, presented at the World level in parts per million (ppm).  The data comes from the National Oceanic and Atmopsheric Administration (NOAA), and is updated monthly.  Like the previous data set, this can be downloaded as a csv file, and easily read into R Studios.


### Change in Mean Sea Levels
https://climatedata.imf.org/datasets/b84a7e25159b4c65ba62d3f82c605855/explore 

This data set showcases the changes in mean sea levels across 24 regions of the world, and the specific measurements (in millimeters) are estimated from satellite radar altimeters.  This data comes from NOAA, and its time series information is presented from 1992 to 2022, with 3/4 data points for every month in between.  Like the previous data set, this can be downloaded as a csv file, and easily read into R Studios.

### Climate Related Disasters Frequency
https://climatedata.imf.org/datasets/b13b69ee0dde43a99c811f592af4e821/explore 

This data set showcases the trend in the number of climate related natural disasters each year, by country.  The data comes from the Emergency Events Database, which covers disasters that killed more than ten people, affected more than a hundred people, led to the declaration of a state of emergency, and led to a call for international assistance.  This time series data is updated yearly, and can be downloaded as a csv file, easily read into R Studios.  

### Change in Sea Ice Volume
http://psc.apl.uw.edu/research/projects/arctic-sea-ice-volume-anomaly/data/.

This data set showcases the monthly changes in sea ice volume across the world from 1979 through present. The data is collected by The University of Washingtonâ€™s Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean and Modeling System, or PIOMAS. This data set is in ASCII table format with 12 columns for each month and 44 rows for years 1979-present. The volume is 103 km3. Missing values are coded as -1, and it is updated monthly. The data set is available in text file and CSV file For this project, we plan to use import the csv version into R by calling read.csv().
