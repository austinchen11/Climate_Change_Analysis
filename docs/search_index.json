Throughout the scientific community, climate change is no longer considered to be a “future” issue, in fact, changes to Earth’s climate driven by the increased emissions of fossil fuels are already having widespread effects on the environment: rising global temperatures, shrinking ice sheets and glaciers, rising sea levels, depleting ozone, and extreme weather events such as droughts, heatwaves, and excessive rainfall. Most, if not all of these changes can be attributed to quantifiable human factors, therefore, our project - Climate Change Analysis - seeks to explore and visualize these relationships. For example, by examining time series data (by country) on atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, mean temperature change, mean sea level change, energy consumption, air pollution …etc, we are hopefully able to gain some valuable insights on what each individual country’s “contribution” to climate change is. Furthermore, by bringing in additional data such as the population, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and other characteristics of those same countries, a more significant relationship can potentially be realized. Understanding that much of the world has been plagued by a global pandemic during the last couple of years (which undoubtedly affects human activity), we also seek to compare metrics such as air pollution before and during COVID-19. Lastly, with the adoption of the Paris Agreement, focusing on climate change adaptation and finance, in 2015, we are interesting in seeing which countries actually implemented the proposed strategies to mitigate their climate contributions. 2.2 Data availability With climate change being such a forefront issue in the world today, there are vast amounts of data available on this subject, from a multitude of sources such as NASA, NOAA, and other climate organizations around the world. Therefore, our group is planning to combine multiple data sets to output a more comprehensive analysis. The following sections will denote the data sets we plan on using, as well as any relevant information regarding the data source and data collection process. 2.2.1 Annual Surface Temperature Change https://climatedata.imf.org/datasets/4063314923d74187be9596f10d034914/explore https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/ET This data set showcases the annual estimates of mean surface temperature change from 1961 to 2021 by country, with respect to a baseline climatology (defined as the period of 1951 to 1980). The data comes from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and is updated annually, as it is a yearly time series data. The data is downloadable as a csv file, which can easily be read into R Studios. 2.2.2 Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Concentrations https://climatedata.imf.org/datasets/9c3764c0efcc4c71934ab3988f219e0e/explore https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/ This data set showcases the monthly atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, presented at the World level in parts per million (ppm). The data comes from the National Oceanic and Atmopsheric Administration (NOAA), and is updated monthly. Like the previous data set, this can be downloaded as a csv file, and easily read into R Studios. 2.2.3 Change in Mean Sea Levels https://climatedata.imf.org/datasets/b84a7e25159b4c65ba62d3f82c605855/explore This data set showcases the changes in mean sea levels across 24 regions of the world, and the specific measurements (in millimeters) are estimated from satellite radar altimeters. This data comes from NOAA, and its time series information is presented from 1992 to 2022, with 3/4 data points for every month in between. Like the previous data set, this can be downloaded as a csv file, and easily read into R Studios. 2.2.4 Climate Related Disasters Frequency https://climatedata.imf.org/datasets/b13b69ee0dde43a99c811f592af4e821/explore This data set showcases the trend in the number of climate related natural disasters each year, by country. The data comes from the Emergency Events Database, which covers disasters that killed more than ten people, affected more than a hundred people, led to the declaration of a state of emergency, and led to a call for international assistance. This time series data is updated yearly, and can be downloaded as a csv file, easily read into R Studios. 2.2.5 Change in Sea Ice Volume http://psc.apl.uw.edu/research/projects/arctic-sea-ice-volume-anomaly/data/. This data set showcases the monthly changes in sea ice volume across the world from 1979 through present. The data is collected by The University of Washington’s Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean and Modeling System, or PIOMAS. This data set is in ASCII table format with 12 columns for each month and 44 rows for years 1979-present. The volume is 103 km3. Missing values are coded as -1, and it is updated monthly. The data set is available in text file and CSV file For this project, we plan to use import the csv version into R by calling read.csv(). 2.2.6 Greenhouse Gas Emission https://www.climatewatchdata.org/data-explorer/historical-emissions?historical-emissions-data-sources=cait&amp;historical-emissions-gases=All%20Selected%2Call-ghg&amp;historical-emissions-regions=All%20Selected&amp;historical-emissions-sectors=%2Ctotal-including-lucf&amp;page=1#data This data set showcases sector-level greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for 194 countries and the European Union from 1990-2019.

"],["data.html", "Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.3 Missing value analysis", " Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources The topic of our project - “Climate Change” - is by nature, broad; therefore, in order to answer the various questions of concern/interest, we had to incorporate many different data sources. We will describe each of them below: 3.1.1 Annual Surface Temperature Change https://climatedata.imf.org/datasets/4063314923d74187be9596f10d034914/explore https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/ET This data set showcases the annual estimates of mean surface temperature change from 1961 to 2021 by country, with respect to a baseline climatology (defined as the period of 1951 to 1980). The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations is the group that is responsible for compiling this data for public use; however, it seems like the FAO retrieves the data from elsewhere. According to its website, the information comes from the publicly available GISTEMP data, managed by NASA-GISS. With climate data, there are always a multitude of sources/options available, but I chose this specific website due to the accessible and downloadable CSV file, and the plethora of references it included. The CSV file includes 227 different countries, each with time series data from 1961 to 2021. Although there are other columns in the CSV, they are not relevant for our analysis. There are two main issues with the data: missing values and messy format. Both of these issues are easily dealt with using some data manipulation in R. 3.1.2 Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Concentrations https://climatedata.imf.org/datasets/9c3764c0efcc4c71934ab3988f219e0e/explore https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/ This data set showcases the monthly atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, presented at the World level in parts per million (ppm). The data is collected by the Global Monitoring Laboratory of NOAA (specifically measured at Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii). The data from this region actually constitutes the longest running direct measurement of carbon dioxide in the world. There were other measures of carbon dioxide available, but since most climate analysis utilizes the data from Mauna Loa, I did not want to deviate from that. The CSV file includes 1536 rows, with the world carbon dioxide concentration (in percent and parts per million) from 1958 to 2022. There are other categorical variables in the data that are not necessary for our analysis. The data itself is relatively clean; however, the format of file (like changing the dates into the correct format) will need to be slightly tweaked. 3.1.3 Change in Mean Sea Levels https://climatedata.imf.org/datasets/b84a7e25159b4c65ba62d3f82c605855/explore This data set showcases the changes in mean sea levels across 24 regions of the world, and the specific measurements (in millimeters) are estimated from satellite radar altimeters. The data is collected by the Laboratory for Satellite Altimetry from NOAA. These estimates of sea level rise are based on measurements from satellite radar altimeters. These satellites “basically determine the distance from the satellite to a target surface by measuring the satellite-to-surface round-trip time of a radar pulse.” Like the previous data sources, I chose it due to the reputation of NOAA as an organization. The CSV file has 35,379 rows, which encompasses the time series sea level change data from 1992 to 2022 for 24 regions around the world. Other categorical variables exist, but are not necessary for our analysis. The data does not have any apparent issues, but the formatting (like with most data) will have to be tailored to our specific project 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.3 Missing value analysis "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results 4.1 GDP 4.2 Population 4.3 Air Pollution 4.4 Carbon Dioxide 4.5 Temperature Change 4.6 Sea Level Change 4.7 Temperature Change and GDP 4.8 Temperature Change and Population 4.9 Temperature Change, Population, GDP 4.10 Sea Level Change and Sea Ice 4.11 Temperature Change and Greenhouse Gases", " Chapter 4 Results 4.1 GDP df_gdp &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/gdp.csv&quot;) top10_gdp_2021 &lt;- df_gdp[df_gdp$Subject == &quot;Gross Domestic Product (GDP); millions&quot; &amp; df_gdp$TIME == 2021 &amp; df_gdp$Measure == &quot;USD, current prices, current PPPs&quot;,] top10_gdp_2021[ order(top10_gdp_2021$Value,decreasing = TRUE), ][0:14,] ## LOCATION Country SUBJECT Subject MEASURE Measure ## 44648 OECD OECD - Total T_GDP Gross Domestic Product (GDP); millions CPC USD, current prices, current PPPs ## 43634 G-7 G7 T_GDP Gross Domestic Product (GDP); millions CPC USD, current prices, current PPPs ## 23980 USA United States T_GDP Gross Domestic Product (GDP); millions CPC USD, current prices, current PPPs ## 50643 EU27_2020 European Union – 27 countries (from 01/02/2020) T_GDP Gross Domestic Product (GDP); millions CPC USD, current prices, current PPPs ## 47400 EA19 Euro area (19 countries) T_GDP Gross Domestic Product (GDP); millions CPC USD, current prices, current PPPs ## 26702 IND India T_GDP Gross Domestic Product (GDP); millions CPC USD, current prices, current PPPs ## 11669 JPN Japan T_GDP Gross Domestic Product (GDP); millions CPC USD, current prices, current PPPs ## 6828 DEU Germany T_GDP Gross Domestic Product (GDP); millions CPC USD, current prices, current PPPs ## 27030 IDN Indonesia T_GDP Gross Domestic Product (GDP); millions CPC USD, current prices, current PPPs ## 5944 FRA France T_GDP Gross Domestic Product (GDP); millions CPC USD, current prices, current PPPs ## 24710 BRA Brazil T_GDP Gross Domestic Product (GDP); millions CPC USD, current prices, current PPPs ## 23096 GBR United Kingdom T_GDP Gross Domestic Product (GDP); millions CPC USD, current prices, current PPPs ## 10785 ITA Italy T_GDP Gross Domestic Product (GDP); millions CPC USD, current prices, current PPPs ## 14279 MEX Mexico T_GDP Gross Domestic Product (GDP); millions CPC USD, current prices, current PPPs ## TIME Time Unit.Code Unit PowerCode.Code PowerCode Reference.Period.Code Reference.Period Value Flag.Codes Flags ## 44648 2021 2021 USD US Dollar 6 Millions 67273433 ## 43634 2021 2021 USD US Dollar 6 Millions 45020341 ## 23980 2021 2021 USD US Dollar 6 Millions 23315100 ## 50643 2021 2021 USD US Dollar 6 Millions 21759094 ## 47400 2021 2021 USD US Dollar 6 Millions 17495016 ## 26702 2021 2021 USD US Dollar 6 Millions 9856675 ## 11669 2021 2021 USD US Dollar 6 Millions 5400596 ## 6828 2021 2021 USD US Dollar 6 Millions 4857465 ## 27030 2021 2021 USD US Dollar 6 Millions 3566265 ## 5944 2021 2021 USD US Dollar 6 Millions 3447940 ## 24710 2021 2021 USD US Dollar 6 Millions 3435882 ## 23096 2021 2021 USD US Dollar 6 Millions 3286242 ## 10785 2021 2021 USD US Dollar 6 Millions 2723375 ## 14279 2021 2021 USD US Dollar 6 Millions 2609520 From the GDP dataset, we found that the top ten countries which have the highest GDP in 2021 (in USD, current prices, current PPPs) are: USA, India, Japan, Germany, Indonesia, France, Brazil, UK, Italy, Mexico. The dataset doesn’t contain China’s GDP value in 2021 (but does contain from 1970-2020); this is not reflected as a null value in the dataset. Since China’s GDP is also among the highest in the world before, we decided to include USA, India, Japan, Germany, Indonesia, France, Brazil, UK, Italy, Mexico, and China in our future analysis. country_gdp = c(&quot;United States&quot;, &quot;India&quot;, &quot;Japan&quot;, &quot;Germany&quot;, &quot;Indonesia&quot;, &quot;France&quot;, &quot;Brazil&quot;, &quot;United Kingdom&quot;, &quot;Italy&quot;, &quot;Mexico&quot;, &quot;China (People&#39;s Republic of)&quot;) fig_gdp2 &lt;- ggplot( subset(df_gdp, Country %in% country_gdp &amp; Subject %in% &quot;Gross Domestic Product (GDP); millions&quot; &amp; Measure %in% &quot;USD, current prices, current PPPs&quot;), aes(x = Time, y = Value, color = Country, group = Country)) + geom_line() + labs(title = &quot;GDP from 1970 - 2021&quot;, x = &quot;Year&quot;, y = &quot;GDP&quot;) plot(fig_gdp2) 4.2 Population fig_pop1 &lt;- ggplot( subset(df_gdp, Country %in% country_gdp &amp; Subject %in% &quot;Total population; persons; thousands&quot;), aes(x = Time, y = Value, color = Country, group = Country)) + geom_line() + labs(title = &quot;Population from 1970 - 2021&quot;, x = &quot;Year&quot;, y = &quot;Population&quot;) plot(fig_pop1) 4.3 Air Pollution air_combined &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/air_combined.csv&quot;) ggplot( air_combined, aes(x = factor(year), y = value, color = country, group = country)) + geom_line() + labs(title = &quot;Air Pollution from 2010 - 2021&quot;, x = &quot;Year&quot;, y = &quot;PM 2.5 concentration (μg/m3)&quot;) ggplot( air_combined, aes(x = year, y = value, color = country, group = country)) + geom_line() + facet_wrap(~country) + labs(title = &quot;Air Pollution from 2010 - 2021&quot;, x = &quot;Year&quot;, y = &quot;PM 2.5 concentration (μg/m3)&quot;) There is a jump in India’s PM2.5 concentration before and after 2017, and the data is missing before 2016. It is reasonable that the data before and after 2017 is inconsistent since the dataset is combined from one dataset from WHO, containing PM2.5 concentration data from 2010 to 2017, and one dataset from IQAir, containing PM2.5 concentration data from 2018 to 2021.
