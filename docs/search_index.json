Throughout the scientific community, climate change is no longer considered to be a “future” issue, in fact, changes to Earth’s climate driven by the increased emissions of fossil fuels are already having widespread effects on the environment: rising global temperatures, shrinking ice sheets and glaciers, rising sea levels, depleting ozone, and extreme weather events such as droughts, heatwaves, and excessive rainfall. Most, if not all of these changes can be attributed to quantifiable human factors, therefore, our project - Climate Change Analysis - seeks to explore and visualize these relationships. For example, by examining time series data (by country) on atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, mean temperature change, mean sea level change, energy consumption, air pollution …etc, we are hopefully able to gain some valuable insights on what each individual country’s “contribution” to climate change is. Furthermore, by bringing in additional data such as the population, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and other characteristics of those same countries, a more significant relationship can potentially be realized. Understanding that much of the world has been plagued by a global pandemic during the last couple of years (which undoubtedly affects human activity), we also seek to compare metrics such as air pollution before and during COVID-19. Lastly, with the adoption of the Paris Agreement, focusing on climate change adaptation and finance, in 2015, we are interesting in seeing which countries actually implemented the proposed strategies to mitigate their climate contributions. 2.2 Data availability With climate change being such a forefront issue in the world today, there are vast amounts of data available on this subject, from a multitude of sources such as NASA, NOAA, and other climate organizations around the world. Therefore, our group is planning to combine multiple data sets to output a more comprehensive analysis. The following sections will denote the data sets we plan on using, as well as any relevant information regarding the data source and data collection process. 2.2.1 Annual Surface Temperature Change https://climatedata.imf.org/datasets/4063314923d74187be9596f10d034914/explore https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/ET This data set showcases the annual estimates of mean surface temperature change from 1961 to 2021 by country, with respect to a baseline climatology (defined as the period of 1951 to 1980). The data comes from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and is updated annually, as it is a yearly time series data. The data is downloadable as a csv file, which can easily be read into R Studios. 2.2.2 Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Concentrations https://climatedata.imf.org/datasets/9c3764c0efcc4c71934ab3988f219e0e/explore https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/ This data set showcases the monthly atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, presented at the World level in parts per million (ppm). The data comes from the National Oceanic and Atmopsheric Administration (NOAA), and is updated monthly. Like the previous data set, this can be downloaded as a csv file, and easily read into R Studios. 2.2.3 Change in Mean Sea Levels https://climatedata.imf.org/datasets/b84a7e25159b4c65ba62d3f82c605855/explore This data set showcases the changes in mean sea levels across 24 regions of the world, and the specific measurements (in millimeters) are estimated from satellite radar altimeters. This data comes from NOAA, and its time series information is presented from 1992 to 2022, with 3/4 data points for every month in between. Like the previous data set, this can be downloaded as a csv file, and easily read into R Studios. 2.2.4 Climate Related Disasters Frequency https://climatedata.imf.org/datasets/b13b69ee0dde43a99c811f592af4e821/explore This data set showcases the trend in the number of climate related natural disasters each year, by country. The data comes from the Emergency Events Database, which covers disasters that killed more than ten people, affected more than a hundred people, led to the declaration of a state of emergency, and led to a call for international assistance. This time series data is updated yearly, and can be downloaded as a csv file, easily read into R Studios. 2.2.5 Change in Sea Ice Volume http://psc.apl.uw.edu/research/projects/arctic-sea-ice-volume-anomaly/data/. This data set showcases the monthly changes in sea ice volume across the world from 1979 through present. The data is collected by The University of Washington’s Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean and Modeling System, or PIOMAS. This data set is in ASCII table format with 12 columns for each month and 44 rows for years 1979-present. The volume is 103 km3. Missing values are coded as -1, and it is updated monthly. The data set is available in text file and CSV file For this project, we plan to use import the csv version into R by calling read.csv(). 2.2.6 Greenhouse Gas Emission https://www.climatewatchdata.org/data-explorer/historical-emissions?historical-emissions-data-sources=cait&amp;historical-emissions-gases=All%20Selected%2Call-ghg&amp;historical-emissions-regions=All%20Selected&amp;historical-emissions-sectors=%2Ctotal-including-lucf&amp;page=1#data This data set showcases sector-level greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for 194 countries and the European Union from 1990-2019. This data is updated regularly including emissions of the six major GHGs, Non-CO2 emissions and other relevant metrics such as population and GDP values. This data set can be downloaded as a csv file, which is easy to import in R. 2.2.7 Change in Forests https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/GF This data set showcases forests consists of CO2 emissions and removals corresponding to forest carbon stock changes. Statistics are available by country from 1990 to 2020. The data are based on United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and are sourced from the most recently available GHG National Inventories (NGHGI). It is updated annually and can be downloaded as a csv file, which is easy to import in R. 2.2.8 Land Use https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/RL This data set showcases the global land use in 46 categories, such as primary forest, agricultural practices and so on. Statistics are availbale by country from 1961 to 2020. The data are collected via the FAO Questionnaire on Land Use, Irrigation and Agricultural Practices, based on FAO Land Use classification. It is updated annually and can be downloaded as a csv file, which is easy to import in R 2.2.9 Population https://data.un.org/_Docs/SYB/CSV/SYB65_1_202209_Population,%20Surface%20Area%20and%20Density.csv This data set showcases the population grouped by country in 2010, 2015, 2017, and 2022, including population estimates, sex ratio, population percentage in different age groups, population density, and surface area. The data comes from United Nations database and is updated recently. It can be downloaded as a csv file. 2.2.10 Population growth https://data.un.org/_Docs/SYB/CSV/SYB65_246_202209_Population%20Growth,%20Fertility%20and%20Mortality%20Indicators.csv This data set showcases the population growth, fertility, life expectancy and mortality grouped by country in 2010, 2015, 2017, and 2022. The data also comes from United Nations database and is updated recently. It can be downloaded as a csv file. 2.2.11 GDP https://data.un.org/Data.aspx?q=gdp&amp;d=SNAAMA&amp;f=grID%3a101%3bcurrID%3aNCU%3bpcFlag%3a0 This data set showcases GDP by type of expenditure (including Final consumption expenditure, Household consumption expenditure, General government final consumption expenditure, etc.) at current prices grouped by country from 1970 to 2020. The data can be downloaded from United Nations database as a csv file and is updated annually. 2.2.12 Air pollution https://data.oecd.org/air/air-pollution-exposure.htm The data set showcases the air pollution exposure by country until 2019. Air pollution exposure in the data refers to population exposure to more than 10 micrograms/m3 of Fine particulate matter (PM2.5). The data comes from Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and can be downloaded as a csv file. "],["data.html", "Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.3 Missing value analysis", " Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources The topic of our project - “Climate Change” - is by nature, broad; therefore, in order to answer the various questions of concern/interest, we had to incorporate many different data sources. We will describe each of them below: 3.1.1 Annual Surface Temperature Change https://climatedata.imf.org/datasets/4063314923d74187be9596f10d034914/explore https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/ET This data set showcases the annual estimates of mean surface temperature change from 1961 to 2021 by country, with respect to a baseline climatology (defined as the period of 1951 to 1980). The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations is the group that is responsible for compiling this data for public use; however, it seems like the FAO retrieves the data from elsewhere. According to its website, the information comes from the publicly available GISTEMP data, managed by NASA-GISS. With climate data, there are always a multitude of sources/options available, but I chose this specific website due to the accessible and downloadable CSV file, and the plethora of references it included. The CSV file includes 227 different countries, each with time series data from 1961 to 2021. Although there are other columns in the CSV, they are not relevant for our analysis. There are two main issues with the data: missing values and messy format. Both of these issues are easily dealt with using some data manipulation in R. 3.1.2 Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Concentrations https://climatedata.imf.org/datasets/9c3764c0efcc4c71934ab3988f219e0e/explore https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/ This data set showcases the monthly atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, presented at the World level in parts per million (ppm). The data is collected by the Global Monitoring Laboratory of NOAA (specifically measured at Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii). The data from this region actually constitutes the longest running direct measurement of carbon dioxide in the world. There were other measures of carbon dioxide available, but since most climate analysis utilizes the data from Mauna Loa, I did not want to deviate from that. The CSV file includes 1536 rows, with the world carbon dioxide concentration (in percent and parts per million) from 1958 to 2022. There are other categorical variables in the data that are not necessary for our analysis. The data itself is relatively clean; however, the format of file (like changing the dates into the correct format) will need to be slightly tweaked. 3.1.3 Change in Mean Sea Levels https://climatedata.imf.org/datasets/b84a7e25159b4c65ba62d3f82c605855/explore This data set showcases the changes in mean sea levels across 24 regions of the world, and the specific measurements (in millimeters) are estimated from satellite radar altimeters. The data is collected by the Laboratory for Satellite Altimetry from NOAA. These estimates of sea level rise are based on measurements from satellite radar altimeters. These satellites “basically determine the distance from the satellite to a target surface by measuring the satellite-to-surface round-trip time of a radar pulse.” Like the previous data sources, I chose it due to the reputation of NOAA as an organization. The CSV file has 35,379 rows, which encompasses the time series sea level change data from 1992 to 2022 for 24 regions around the world. Other categorical variables exist, but are not necessary for our analysis. The data does not have any apparent issues, but the formatting (like with most data) will have to be tailored to our specific project. 3.1.4 GDP and Population https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?DataSetCode=PDB_LV This data set showcases the level of GDP per capita and productivity, including GDP, total population, GDP per head of population, GDP per hour worked, GDP per person employed, etc. in different countries from 1970 to 2021. The data is collected by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and updated regularly. This data set can be downloaded as a csv file, containing 51,746 entries and 17 columns. It is well formatted and does not contain any null values, thus does not require data cleaning and preprocessing. 3.1.5 Air Pollution https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/air-pollution/who-air-quality-database https://www.iqair.com/us/world-most-polluted-countries The first dataset showcases PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 concentration and temporal coverage from 2010 to 2018 in different countries and cities. The data is collected by WHO, and as described on the website, “the primary sources of data were official reports of countries sent to WHO upon request.” It can be downloaded as an excel file and contains 32191 entries and 15 columns. This dataset contains null values and other irrelevant information, thus it requires cleaning and preprocessing. Since we want to compare the air pollution before and after the rise of Covid-19, around 2019, we found another dataset which contains more up-to-date information. The second dataset from IQAir showcases PM2.5 concentration from 2018 to 2021 in 117 countries and contains 472 entries and 5 columns. The data cannot be downloaded, therefore, we choose to do web scraping and perform further cleaning and transformation. Finally, we combine these two datasets and do further analysis. 3.2 Cleaning / transformation Most of the data used in this project are Time Series data for different countries of the world; therefore, depending on the type of graph or type of merge/join we want to accomplish, the cleaning/transformation will differ. We will denote some of them below: 3.2.1 GDP and Population The original dataset about GDP is from the United Nations, which showcases the GDP by country from 1970 to 2020. However, after plotting GDP values against year grouped by country, we found that the GDP of Japan and the US are two outliers, which have GDP much higher than other countries. Comparing this data with the other information we found, we concluded that this dataset contains wrong information and decided to search for other datasets. The original dataset about population is from United Nations, containing total population and population growth in different countries in 2010, 2015, 2017, and 2022. After exploring the data, we realized that we need more datapoints in terms of year. Therefore, we decided to use a new dataset from OECD which contains more comprehensive data, including the GDP, population, and other information in each country from 1970 to 2021. 3.2.2 Air Pollution The first air pollution dataset from WHO contains PM2.5 concentration in different cities. We drop all the null values and compute the average PM2.5 concentration among all the cities in each country in each year. We scrape the second dataset from IQAir website, and convert it from wide to long format. We select PM2.5 concentration from countries with top 11 highest GDP and combine these two datasets for further analysis. 3.2.3 Annual Surface Temperature Change The temperature change data set included quite a bit of unnecessary categorical columns, therefore, as noted by the code snippet below, I removed them from the data frame. Furthermore, missing values were simply omitted from the data set for a more complete analysis going forward. In order to transform the data into a format that was easily graph-able, I used the function “melt” from the reshape2 library, which allowed for easier time series plotting. Lastly, our group unanimously decided to only analyze the top 11 countries (based on GDP), since it is nearly impossible to evaluate 200+ countries of the world. 3.2.4 Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Concentrations The carbon dioxide data set did not require much transformation, as I only needed to remove some unnecessary columns and make sure all of the measurements were in parts per million. 3.2.5 Change in Mean Sea Levels The sea level change data set required quite a bit of transformation before it was plot-ready. First, all of the unnecessary categorical variables were removed, and the “Date” column was formatted into a more traditional Date format. Furthermore, multiple “group_by”s were conducted in order to output the mean sea level change of each calendar year for each of the regions included in the data set. 3.3 Missing value analysis Two of our data sets included some missing values; we will denote their analysis below. 3.3.1 Annual Surface Temperature Change ## Country F1961 F1962 F1963 F1964 F1965 F1966 F1967 F1968 F1969 F1970 F1971 F1972 F1973 F1974 F1975 F1976 F1977 F1978 ## 0 36 35 36 37 37 33 35 36 36 37 34 32 32 34 37 35 36 35 ## F1979 F1980 F1981 F1982 F1983 F1984 F1985 F1986 F1987 F1988 F1989 F1990 F1991 F1992 F1993 F1994 F1995 F1996 F1997 ## 36 34 35 35 38 37 37 36 36 36 35 36 37 16 18 18 16 16 19 ## F1998 F1999 F2000 F2001 F2002 F2003 F2004 F2005 F2006 F2007 F2008 F2009 F2010 F2011 F2012 F2013 F2014 F2015 F2016 ## 15 17 16 18 15 12 13 14 11 10 14 13 12 10 13 11 11 11 12 ## F2017 F2018 F2019 F2020 F2021 ## 13 11 12 13 13 ## NOTE: The following pairs of variables appear to have the same missingness pattern. ## Please verify whether they are in fact logically distinct variables. ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] &quot;F1972&quot; &quot;F1973&quot; ## [2,] &quot;F1987&quot; &quot;F1988&quot; ## [3,] &quot;F2013&quot; &quot;F2014&quot; ## [4,] &quot;F2013&quot; &quot;F2015&quot; ## [5,] &quot;F2013&quot; &quot;F2018&quot; ## [6,] &quot;F2014&quot; &quot;F2015&quot; ## [7,] &quot;F2014&quot; &quot;F2018&quot; ## [8,] &quot;F2015&quot; &quot;F2018&quot; 3.3.2 Air Pollution ## NOTE: In the following pairs of variables, the missingness pattern of the first is a subset of the second. ## Please verify whether they are in fact logically distinct variables. ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] &quot;WHO.Region&quot; &quot;PM2.5.(μg/m3)&quot; ## [2,] &quot;WHO.Region&quot; &quot;PM25.temporal.coverage.(%)&quot; ## [3,] &quot;WHO.Region&quot; &quot;Number.and.type.of.monitoring.stations&quot; ## [4,] &quot;WHO.Region&quot; &quot;Status&quot; ## [5,] &quot;PM2.5.(μg/m3)&quot; &quot;Status&quot; ## [6,] &quot;PM10.(μg/m3)&quot; &quot;Status&quot; ## [7,] &quot;NO2.(μg/m3)&quot; &quot;Status&quot; ## [8,] &quot;PM25.temporal.coverage.(%)&quot; &quot;Status&quot; ## [9,] &quot;PM10.temporal.coverage.(%)&quot; &quot;Status&quot; ## [10,] &quot;NO2.temporal.coverage.(%)&quot; &quot;Status&quot; ## [11,] &quot;Reference&quot; &quot;Status&quot; ## [12,] &quot;Number.and.type.of.monitoring.stations&quot; &quot;Status&quot; The air pollution data set from WHO contains many null values, specifically in 7 columns named PM2.5 (μg/m3), PM10 (μg/m3), NO2 (μg/m3), PM25 temporal coverage (%), PM10 temporal coverage (%), NO2 temporal coverage (%), Number and type of monitoring stations. We focus on PM2.5 (μg/m3) values. We drop the rows which are NAs in this column. Since we compute the average for each country, dropping null values has little impact on our results.

The dataset doesn’t contain China’s GDP value in 2021 (but does contain from 1970-2020); this is not reflected as a null value in the dataset. Since China’s GDP is also among the highest in the world before, we decided to include 11 countries: USA, India, Japan, Germany, Indonesia, France, Brazil, UK, Italy, Mexico, and China in our future analysis. country_gdp = c(&quot;United States&quot;, &quot;India&quot;, &quot;Japan&quot;, &quot;Germany&quot;, &quot;Indonesia&quot;, &quot;France&quot;, &quot;Brazil&quot;, &quot;United Kingdom&quot;, &quot;Italy&quot;, &quot;Mexico&quot;, &quot;China (People&#39;s Republic of)&quot;) fig_gdp2 &lt;- ggplot( subset(df_gdp, Country %in% country_gdp &amp; Subject %in% &quot;Gross Domestic Product (GDP); millions&quot; &amp; Measure %in% &quot;USD, current prices, current PPPs&quot;), aes(x = Time, y = Value, color = Country, group = Country)) + geom_line() + labs(title = &quot;GDP from 1970 - 2021&quot;, x = &quot;Year&quot;, y = &quot;GDP&quot;) plot(fig_gdp2) From the plot, we can see that China and US’s GDP are much higher than other countries from 2010 to present. China’s GDP is relatively low before 1990, but it grows rapidly and exceeds US’s GDP from 2017 until present. India’s GDP is also growing rapidly in recent years. Other countries’ GDP are growing steadily. 4.2 Population fig_pop1 &lt;- ggplot( subset(df_gdp, Country %in% country_gdp &amp; Subject %in% &quot;Total population; persons; thousands&quot;), aes(x = Time, y = Value, color = Country, group = Country)) + geom_line() + labs(title = &quot;Population from 1970 - 2021&quot;, x = &quot;Year&quot;, y = &quot;Population&quot;) plot(fig_pop1) China and India are the top 2 countries which have highest population and population growth rate from 1970 to 2021. China has about 1.42 billion people and India has 1.41 billion in 2021. US, Indonesia, and Brazil ranks the 3rd, 4th, and 5th by population. Other countries’ population grows steadily. 4.3 Air Pollution air_combined &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/air_combined.csv&quot;) ggplot( air_combined, aes(x = factor(year), y = value, color = country, group = country)) + geom_line() + labs(title = &quot;Air Pollution from 2010 - 2021&quot;, x = &quot;Year&quot;, y = &quot;PM 2.5 concentration (μg/m3)&quot;) ggplot( air_combined, aes(x = year, y = value, color = country, group = country)) + geom_line() + facet_wrap(~country) + labs(title = &quot;Air Pollution from 2010 - 2021&quot;, x = &quot;Year&quot;, y = &quot;PM 2.5 concentration (μg/m3)&quot;) There is a jump in India’s PM2.5 concentration before and after 2017, and the data is missing before 2016. It is reasonable that the data are inconsistent since the dataset is combined from two datasets. The data from other countries are consistent. From the IQAir website, the PM2.5 concentration from 0-5 μg/m3 meets WHO guidelines. We can see that China is the most polluted country before 2017, but the air pollution index continues decreasing and in 2021, China’s PM2.5 index is 32.6 μg/m3. India and Indonesia are the top 2 most polluted countries in 2021, with PM2.5 concentration 58.1 and 34.3 μg/m3. Other countries have relatively low air pollution. Our analysis of this graph focus on the impact of Covid-19 on air pollution. Since during the pandemic, there are less outside activities. We compare the data before and after 2019 and see if there is a decreasing trend after Covid-19, as we expected. China and Indonesia’s air pollution value decrease rapidly; Brazil, Italy, Japan, and Mexico have a slight decrease; France, Germany, UK are steady; India and US’s air pollution value increase. The trend and the impact of Covid-19 are different for each country. Air pollution values are affected by multiple factors. 4.4 Carbon Dioxide world_co2 = read.csv(&#39;data/Atmospheric_CO%E2%82%82_Concentrations.csv&#39;, stringsAsFactors = TRUE) world_co2 = world_co2[, -c(1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10)] world_co2 = world_co2[world_co2$Unit == &quot;Parts Per Million&quot;, ] world_co2$Date = gsub(&quot;M&quot;,&quot;-&quot;, world_co2$Date) g1 = ggplot(data = world_co2, aes(x = Date, y = Value)) + geom_point() + labs(title = &quot;World Carbon Dioxide Concentration From 1958 to 2022&quot;, x = &quot;Year&quot;, y = &quot;Carbon Dioxide (Parts per Million)&quot;) g2 = ggplot(data = world_co2[731:774,], aes(x = Date, y = Value)) + geom_point() + labs(title = &quot;World Carbon Dioxide Concentration From 2019 to 2022&quot;, x = &quot;Year&quot;, y = &quot;Carbon Dioxide (Parts per Million)&quot;) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) gridExtra::grid.arrange(g1, g2, nrow = 1) One of the most indicative measurements to showcase Earth’s gradually changing climate is the concentration of carbon dioxide (taken at Mauna Loa, Hawaii). Since 1958, Mauna Loa was chosen as a long term monitoring site, due to its lack of vegetation and remote location far from other continents. As shown in the graphs above, the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere has increased from around 313 parts per million in 1958 to over 420 parts per million in 2022. This increase can be attributed to the release of fossil fuels in the atmosphere, which has accelerated since the industrial revolution, and is one of contributors to global warming. In addition to the general pattern of increase exhibited by the graph on the left, the graph on the right displays the seasonality of carbon dioxide data. This curve (known as the Keeling Curve) shows a cyclic variation of about 6 ppm each calendar year, with a peak in May and a minimum in September. The variation is due to the uptake of carbon dioxide by the world’s land vegetation; from the maximum in May, the concentration decreases as new plant growth during Northern hemisphere’s spring and summer absorbs carbon dioxide through Photosynthesis. This set of graphs also allows us to preface the analysis of this project - since climate data is inherently “noisy” and oftentimes seasonal, it is important to keep that in mind as you read through the document, as some patterns or conclusions may not be as definitive as we would have liked. Nonetheless, we do hope that this project serves it educational purpose on the factors that may affect climate change. 4.5 Temperature Change temp_change = read.csv(&#39;data/Annual_Surface_Temperature_Change.csv&#39;, stringsAsFactors = TRUE) temp_change = temp_change[, -c(3, 4, 5, 6 ,7 ,8 ,9, 10)] temp_change = temp_change[, -c(1)] temp_change_removed = na.omit(temp_change) library(reshape2) df_temp &lt;- melt(subset(temp_change_removed, Country %in% c(&#39;United States&#39;, &#39;India&#39;, &#39;Japan&#39;, &#39;Germany&#39;, &#39;Indonesia&#39;, &#39;France&#39;, &#39;Brazil&#39;, &#39;United Kingdom&#39;, &#39;Italy&#39;, &#39;Mexico&#39;, &#39;China, P.R.: Mainland&#39;)), id.vars=c(&quot;Country&quot;),value.name=&quot;Value&quot;, variable.name=&quot;Year&quot;) df_temp_subset = subset(df_temp, Country %in% c(&#39;United States&#39;, &#39;India&#39;, &#39;Japan&#39;, &#39;Germany&#39;, &#39;Indonesia&#39;, &#39;France&#39;, &#39;Brazil&#39;, &#39;United Kingdom&#39;, &#39;Italy&#39;, &#39;Mexico&#39;, &#39;China, P.R.: Mainland&#39;)) df_temp_subset$Year = substring(df_temp_subset$Year, 2) df_temp_subset_average = df_temp_subset %&gt;% group_by(Country) %&gt;% summarise(average = mean(Value)) ggplot(data=df_temp_subset, aes(x=as.numeric(Year), y=Value, group = Country, colour = Country)) + geom_line() + geom_point() + xlab(&#39;Year&#39;) + ylab(&quot;Temperature Change in Degrees Celsius &quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;Temperature Change of 11 Countries (Top GDPs) from 1961-2021&quot;) ggplot(data = df_temp_subset, aes(x = reorder(Country, Value, median), y = Value)) + geom_boxplot() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) 4.6 Sea Level Change sea_level_change = read.csv(&quot;data/Change_in_Mean_Sea_Levels.csv&quot;, stringsAsFactors = TRUE) sea_level_change = sea_level_change[, -c(1:10)] ggplot(data = sea_level_change, aes(x = reorder(Measure, Value, median), y = Value)) + geom_boxplot() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) + xlab(&quot;Measurements of Oceans and Seas&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Mean Sea Level Change (millimeters&quot;) interactive_sea = sea_level_change interactive_sea$Date = substr(interactive_sea$Date, 1, 4) interactive_sea_tidy = interactive_sea %&gt;% group_by(Date, Measure) %&gt;% summarise(Sea_lvl_change = mean(Value)) ggplot(data = interactive_sea_tidy, aes(x = as.numeric(Date), y = Sea_lvl_change, group = Measure, colour = Measure)) + geom_line() + xlab(&quot;Measurements of Oceans and Seas&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Mean Sea Level Change (millimeters&quot;) ggplot(data = interactive_sea_tidy, aes(x = reorder(Measure, Sea_lvl_change, median), y = Sea_lvl_change)) + geom_boxplot() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) + xlab(&quot;Measurements of Oceans and Seas&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Mean Sea Level Change (millimeters&quot;) 4.7 Temperature Change and GDP df_temp_subset_1970 = df_temp_subset[df_temp_subset$Year &gt;= 1970,] df_temp_subset_1970$Country = as.character(df_temp_subset_1970$Country) df_temp_subset_1970$Country[df_temp_subset_1970$Country == &quot;China, P.R.: Mainland&quot;] = &quot;China (People&#39;s Republic of)&quot;
