[["index.html", "Climate Change Analysis and Visualization Chapter 1 Introduction", " Climate Change Analysis and Visualization Austin Chen, Kelly Du, Dianjing Fan 2022-12-15 Chapter 1 Introduction Since the dawn of the industrial revolution, the topic of climate change has become increasingly more prevalent, as human induced factors (spurred by the technological advancements of the 21st century), has affected Earth in a negative way. While we absolutely should rejoice and marvel at how far humanity has come, we should also take a step back, and look at how our actions can impact the environment. This increasing relevance, as well as the implications that climate change can have on the survival of the human race, are the two primary reasons why our group decided to explore this topic. Climate change as a topic, as you might expect, is extremely broad (commonly defined as the long term change in Earth’s climate and weather patterns); therefore, our group decided to narrow the field and focus on a few specific target questions that are of interest to us. The organization of our project is quite simple, we will first discuss the individual quantities of concern (like GDP, population, temperature change …etc), and in the latter half of the analysis, we will attempt to combine some of these factors and generalize the relationship inferred from the graphs resulting from these merges. Our topics are as follows: There are countless countries in the world, therefore, it is almost impossible to produce a coherent analysis of all of these countries in such of short amount of time. Thus, to make our analysis tangible, a subset of them - top 11 GDP’s of the world - will be selected (these countries will be referred to as “project countries” from here on out). Examine the GDP of the project countries from 1970 to 2021 (this list of 11 countries will be carried throughout the project). Population of the project countries from 1970 to 2021 Air Pollution from 2021 to 2021 Carbon dioxide concentrations from 1958 to 2022 The temperature change of the project countries from 1961 to 2021 The mean sea level change of 24 regions from 1992 to 2021 Changes in greenhouse gas concentrations of the project countries from 1990 to 2019 Changes in the forest area of the project countries from 1990 to 2019 Changes in the agricultural area of the project countries from 1990 to 2019 The above 9 questions encompasses all of the individual analysis our group conducted. The topics below will be focuses on generalizing relationships between two or more of the above features What is the relationship between the GDP and temperature change of a country? What is the relationship between the population and the temperature change of a country? What is the relationship between mean sea level change and the sea ice concentration of the world? As you read through our project book, we hope that you will gain some valuable insights into most of these factors, factors that undoubtedly affect Earth’s climate, and by extension, the survival of our race! (a semi-hyperbole is employed here) "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic Climate change is commonly referred to as the long term change in Earth’s climate and weather patterns, and although these changes may be naturally occurring, since the 1800s, artificial human activities have been the main driver. Throughout the scientific community, climate change is no longer considered to be a “future” issue, in fact, changes to Earth’s climate driven by the increased emissions of fossil fuels are already having widespread effects on the environment: rising global temperatures, shrinking ice sheets and glaciers, rising sea levels, depleting ozone, and extreme weather events such as droughts, heatwaves, and excessive rainfall. Most, if not all of these changes can be attributed to quantifiable human factors, therefore, our project - Climate Change Analysis - seeks to explore and visualize these relationships. For example, by examining time series data (by country) on atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, mean temperature change, mean sea level change, energy consumption, air pollution …etc, we are hopefully able to gain some valuable insights on what each individual country’s “contribution” to climate change is. Furthermore, by bringing in additional data such as the population, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and other characteristics of those same countries, a more significant relationship can potentially be realized. Understanding that much of the world has been plagued by a global pandemic during the last couple of years (which undoubtedly affects human activity), we also seek to compare metrics such as air pollution before and during COVID-19. Lastly, with the adoption of the Paris Agreement, focusing on climate change adaptation and finance, in 2015, we are interesting in seeing which countries actually implemented the proposed strategies to mitigate their climate contributions. 2.2 Data availability With climate change being such a forefront issue in the world today, there are vast amounts of data available on this subject, from a multitude of sources such as NASA, NOAA, and other climate organizations around the world. Therefore, our group is planning to combine multiple data sets to output a more comprehensive analysis. The following sections will denote the data sets we plan on using, as well as any relevant information regarding the data source and data collection process. 2.2.1 Annual Surface Temperature Change https://climatedata.imf.org/datasets/4063314923d74187be9596f10d034914/explore https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/ET This data set showcases the annual estimates of mean surface temperature change from 1961 to 2021 by country, with respect to a baseline climatology (defined as the period of 1951 to 1980).

This data comes from NOAA, and its time series information is presented from 1992 to 2022, with 3/4 data points for every month in between. Like the previous data set, this can be downloaded as a csv file, and easily read into R Studios. 2.2.4 Climate Related Disasters Frequency https://climatedata.imf.org/datasets/b13b69ee0dde43a99c811f592af4e821/explore This data set showcases the trend in the number of climate related natural disasters each year, by country. The data comes from the Emergency Events Database, which covers disasters that killed more than ten people, affected more than a hundred people, led to the declaration of a state of emergency, and led to a call for international assistance. This time series data is updated yearly, and can be downloaded as a csv file, easily read into R Studios. 2.2.5 Change in Sea Ice Volume http://psc.apl.uw.edu/research/projects/arctic-sea-ice-volume-anomaly/data/. This data set showcases the monthly changes in sea ice volume across the world from 1979 through present. The data is collected by The University of Washington’s Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean and Modeling System, or PIOMAS. This data set is in ASCII table format with 12 columns for each month and 44 rows for years 1979-present. The volume is 103 km3. Missing values are coded as -1, and it is updated monthly. The data set is available in text file and CSV file For this project, we plan to use import the csv version into R by calling read.csv(). 2.2.6 Greenhouse Gas Emission https://www.climatewatchdata.org/data-explorer/historical-emissions?historical-emissions-data-sources=cait&amp;historical-emissions-gases=All%20Selected%2Call-ghg&amp;historical-emissions-regions=All%20Selected&amp;historical-emissions-sectors=%2Ctotal-including-lucf&amp;page=1#data This data set showcases sector-level greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for 194 countries and the European Union from 1990-2019. This data is updated regularly including emissions of the six major GHGs, Non-CO2 emissions and other relevant metrics such as population and GDP values. This data set can be downloaded as a csv file, which is easy to import in R. 2.2.7 Change in Forests https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/GF This data set showcases forests consists of CO2 emissions and removals corresponding to forest carbon stock changes. Statistics are available by country from 1990 to 2020. The data are based on United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and are sourced from the most recently available GHG National Inventories (NGHGI). It is updated annually and can be downloaded as a csv file, which is easy to import in R. 2.2.8 Land Use https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/RL This data set showcases the global land use in 46 categories, such as primary forest, agricultural practices and so on. Statistics are availbale by country from 1961 to 2020. The data are collected via the FAO Questionnaire on Land Use, Irrigation and Agricultural Practices, based on FAO Land Use classification. It is updated annually and can be downloaded as a csv file, which is easy to import in R 2.2.9 Population https://data.un.org/_Docs/SYB/CSV/SYB65_1_202209_Population,%20Surface%20Area%20and%20Density.csv This data set showcases the population grouped by country in 2010, 2015, 2017, and 2022, including population estimates, sex ratio, population percentage in different age groups, population density, and surface area. The data comes from United Nations database and is updated recently. It can be downloaded as a csv file. 2.2.10 Population growth https://data.un.org/_Docs/SYB/CSV/SYB65_246_202209_Population%20Growth,%20Fertility%20and%20Mortality%20Indicators.csv This data set showcases the population growth, fertility, life expectancy and mortality grouped by country in 2010, 2015, 2017, and 2022. The data also comes from United Nations database and is updated recently. It can be downloaded as a csv file. 2.2.11 GDP https://data.un.org/Data.aspx?q=gdp&amp;d=SNAAMA&amp;f=grID%3a101%3bcurrID%3aNCU%3bpcFlag%3a0 This data set showcases GDP by type of expenditure (including Final consumption expenditure, Household consumption expenditure, General government final consumption expenditure, etc.) at current prices grouped by country from 1970 to 2020. The data can be downloaded from United Nations database as a csv file and is updated annually. 2.2.12 Air pollution https://data.oecd.org/air/air-pollution-exposure.htm The data set showcases the air pollution exposure by country until 2019. Air pollution exposure in the data refers to population exposure to more than 10 micrograms/m3 of Fine particulate matter (PM2.5). The data comes from Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and can be downloaded as a csv file. "],["data.html", "Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.3 Missing value analysis", " Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources The topic of our project - “Climate Change” - is by nature, broad; therefore, in order to answer the various questions of concern/interest, we had to incorporate many different data sources. We will describe each of them below: 3.1.1 Annual Surface Temperature Change https://climatedata.imf.org/datasets/4063314923d74187be9596f10d034914/explore https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/ET This data set showcases the annual estimates of mean surface temperature change from 1961 to 2021 by country, with respect to a baseline climatology (defined as the period of 1951 to 1980). The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations is the group that is responsible for compiling this data for public use; however, it seems like the FAO retrieves the data from elsewhere. According to its website, the information comes from the publicly available GISTEMP data, managed by NASA-GISS. With climate data, there are always a multitude of sources/options available, but I chose this specific website due to the accessible and downloadable CSV file, and the plethora of references it included. The CSV file includes 227 different countries, each with time series data from 1961 to 2021. Although there are other columns in the CSV, they are not relevant for our analysis. There are two main issues with the data: missing values and messy format. Both of these issues are easily dealt with using some data manipulation in R. 3.1.2 Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Concentrations https://climatedata.imf.org/datasets/9c3764c0efcc4c71934ab3988f219e0e/explore https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/ This data set showcases the monthly atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, presented at the World level in parts per million (ppm). The data is collected by the Global Monitoring Laboratory of NOAA (specifically measured at Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii). The data from this region actually constitutes the longest running direct measurement of carbon dioxide in the world. There were other measures of carbon dioxide available, but since most climate analysis utilizes the data from Mauna Loa, I did not want to deviate from that. The CSV file includes 1536 rows, with the world carbon dioxide concentration (in percent and parts per million) from 1958 to 2022. There are other categorical variables in the data that are not necessary for our analysis. The data itself is relatively clean; however, the format of file (like changing the dates into the correct format) will need to be slightly tweaked. 3.1.3 Change in Mean Sea Levels https://climatedata.imf.org/datasets/b84a7e25159b4c65ba62d3f82c605855/explore This data set showcases the changes in mean sea levels across 24 regions of the world, and the specific measurements (in millimeters) are estimated from satellite radar altimeters. The data is collected by the Laboratory for Satellite Altimetry from NOAA. These estimates of sea level rise are based on measurements from satellite radar altimeters. These satellites “basically determine the distance from the satellite to a target surface by measuring the satellite-to-surface round-trip time of a radar pulse.” Like the previous data sources, I chose it due to the reputation of NOAA as an organization. The CSV file has 35,379 rows, which encompasses the time series sea level change data from 1992 to 2022 for 24 regions around the world. Other categorical variables exist, but are not necessary for our analysis. The data does not have any apparent issues, but the formatting (like with most data) will have to be tailored to our specific project. 3.1.4 GDP and Population https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?DataSetCode=PDB_LV This data set showcases the level of GDP per capita and productivity, including GDP, total population, GDP per head of population, GDP per hour worked, GDP per person employed, etc. in different countries from 1970 to 2021. The data is collected by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and updated regularly. This data set can be downloaded as a csv file, containing 51,746 entries and 17 columns. It is well formatted and does not contain any null values, thus does not require data cleaning and preprocessing. 3.1.5 Air Pollution https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/air-pollution/who-air-quality-database https://www.iqair.com/us/world-most-polluted-countries The first dataset showcases PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 concentration and temporal coverage from 2010 to 2018 in different countries and cities. The data is collected by WHO, and as described on the website, “the primary sources of data were official reports of countries sent to WHO upon request.” It can be downloaded as an excel file and contains 32191 entries and 15 columns. This dataset contains null values and other irrelevant information, thus it requires cleaning and preprocessing. Since we want to compare the air pollution before and after the rise of Covid-19, around 2019, we found another dataset which contains more up-to-date information. The second dataset from IQAir showcases PM2.5 concentration from 2018 to 2021 in 117 countries and contains 472 entries and 5 columns. The data cannot be downloaded, therefore, we choose to do web scraping and perform further cleaning and transformation. Finally, we combine these two datasets and do further analysis. 3.1.6 Greenhouse Gas Emission https://www.climatewatchdata.org/data-explorer/historical-emissions?historical-emissions-data-sources=cait&amp;historical-emissions-gases=All%20Selected%2Call-ghg&amp;historical-emissions-regions=All%20Selected&amp;historical-emissions-sectors=%2Ctotal-including-lucf&amp;page=1#data This data set showcases sector-level greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for 194 countries and the European Union from 1990-2019. This data set is a little messy for time series plots, but it is easy to tidy by R. 3.1.7 Change in Sea Ice Volume http://psc.apl.uw.edu/research/projects/arctic-sea-ice-volume-anomaly/data/. This data set showcases the monthly changes in sea ice volume across the world from 1979 through present. This data set is in ASCII table format with 12 columns for each month and 44 rows for years 1979-present. In order to observe the trend of sea ice volume by years, we calculated the average changes in every year and plot them in time series. 3.1.8 Change in Forests https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/GF This data set showcases forests consists of CO2 emissions and removals corresponding to forest carbon stock changes. Statistics are available by country from 1990 to 2020. The dataset is a well-formated csv file with no missing values. Therefore, it does not require any data cleaning and pre-processing. 3.1.9 Land Use in Agriculture https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/RL The data are collected via the FAO Questionnaire on Land Use, Irrigation and Agricultural Practices, based on FAO Land Use classification. Statistics are available by country from 1961 to 2020. It shows the global land use in 46 categories, such as primary forest, agricultural practices and so on. In this project, we will discuss the changes in agriculture, so we only select the land use in the agriculture category. 3.2 Cleaning / transformation Most of the data used in this project are Time Series data for different countries of the world; therefore, depending on the type of graph or type of merge/join we want to accomplish, the cleaning/transformation will differ. We will denote some of them below: 3.2.1 GDP and Population The original dataset about GDP is from the United Nations, which showcases the GDP by country from 1970 to 2020. However, after plotting GDP values against year grouped by country, we found that the GDP of Japan and the US are two outliers, which have GDP much higher than other countries. Comparing this data with the other information we found, we concluded that this dataset contains wrong information and decided to search for other datasets. The original dataset about population is from United Nations, containing total population and population growth in different countries in 2010, 2015, 2017, and 2022. After exploring the data, we realized that we need more datapoints in terms of year. Therefore, we decided to use a new dataset from OECD which contains more comprehensive data, including the GDP, population, and other information in each country from 1970 to 2021. 3.2.2 Air Pollution The first air pollution dataset from WHO contains PM2.5 concentration in different cities. We drop all the null values and compute the average PM2.5 concentration among all the cities in each country in each year. We scrape the second dataset from IQAir website, and convert it from wide to long format. We select PM2.5 concentration from countries with top 11 highest GDP and combine these two datasets for further analysis. 3.2.3 Annual Surface Temperature Change The temperature change data set included quite a bit of unnecessary categorical columns, therefore, as noted by the code snippet below, I removed them from the data frame. Furthermore, missing values were simply omitted from the data set for a more complete analysis going forward. In order to transform the data into a format that was easily graph-able, I used the function “melt” from the reshape2 library, which allowed for easier time series plotting. Lastly, our group unanimously decided to only analyze the top 11 countries (based on GDP), since it is nearly impossible to evaluate 200+ countries of the world. 3.2.4 Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Concentrations The carbon dioxide data set did not require much transformation, as I only needed to remove some unnecessary columns and make sure all of the measurements were in parts per million. 3.2.5 Change in Mean Sea Levels The sea level change data set required quite a bit of transformation before it was plot-ready. First, all of the unnecessary categorical variables were removed, and the “Date” column was formatted into a more traditional Date format. Furthermore, multiple “group_by”s were conducted in order to output the mean sea level change of each calendar year for each of the regions included in the data set. 3.2.6 Greenhouse Gas Emission The greenhouse gas emission data set included quite a bit of transformation. First, we used mutate_all to convert all columns to characters. The column names X1990-X2019 represent values of the year variable, and the values in these columns represent the values of the greenhouse gas emissions. In order to plot the data set in time series, we used the pivot_longer to tidy the data. 3.2.7 Change in Forests The forest data set did not require much transformation. Since we only need the changes in forests area, we just selected the data in forestland from this data set. 3.2.8 Change in Agricultural Area The land use data set did not require much transformation. Since we only need the changes in agricultural area, we just selected the data in agriculture from this data set. 3.2.9 Change in Sea Ice The Sea Ice Volume data set shows the monthly changes from 1979 through present. To show the trend in years, we need to calculate the average for each year. Therefore, we created a new column named “average” and calculated the row mean of each row. 3.3 Missing value analysis Two of our data sets included some missing values; we will denote their analysis below. 3.3.1 Annual Surface Temperature Change ## Country F1961 F1962 F1963 F1964 F1965 F1966 F1967 F1968 F1969 F1970 F1971 F1972 F1973 F1974 F1975 F1976 F1977 F1978 ## 0 36 35 36 37 37 33 35 36 36 37 34 32 32 34 37 35 36 35 ## F1979 F1980 F1981 F1982 F1983 F1984 F1985 F1986 F1987 F1988 F1989 F1990 F1991 F1992 F1993 F1994 F1995 F1996 F1997 ## 36 34 35 35 38 37 37 36 36 36 35 36 37 16 18 18 16 16 19 ## F1998 F1999 F2000 F2001 F2002 F2003 F2004 F2005 F2006 F2007 F2008 F2009 F2010 F2011 F2012 F2013 F2014 F2015 F2016 ## 15 17 16 18 15 12 13 14 11 10 14 13 12 10 13 11 11 11 12 ## F2017 F2018 F2019 F2020 F2021 ## 13 11 12 13 13 ## NOTE: The following pairs of variables appear to have the same missingness pattern. ## Please verify whether they are in fact logically distinct variables. ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] &quot;F1972&quot; &quot;F1973&quot; ## [2,] &quot;F1987&quot; &quot;F1988&quot; ## [3,] &quot;F2013&quot; &quot;F2014&quot; ## [4,] &quot;F2013&quot; &quot;F2015&quot; ## [5,] &quot;F2013&quot; &quot;F2018&quot; ## [6,] &quot;F2014&quot; &quot;F2015&quot; ## [7,] &quot;F2014&quot; &quot;F2018&quot; ## [8,] &quot;F2015&quot; &quot;F2018&quot; Climate data is inherently messy, and with that messiness, comes the potential to include a significant amount of missing data. As shown in the heat map above, there are two significant chunks of data that are black or missing. The majority of missing data in this data set comes between the years of 1961 and 1991, with 1992 - 2021 representing a smaller percentage of missing values. This observation aligns with logic, as it is more difficult to maintain and obtain data that is older, as opposed to newer data. Additionally, we are typically less confident in the data values from centuries ago; although this data set does not include data that dates that far back, the conclusion stays constant. In order to clean the data, we simply dropped the NA values from the data set, as the countries of interest to us were relatively whole, and the entire data is large enough to still generate meaningful analys 3.3.2 Air Pollution ## NOTE: In the following pairs of variables, the missingness pattern of the first is a subset of the second. ## Please verify whether they are in fact logically distinct variables. ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] &quot;WHO.Region&quot; &quot;PM2.5.(μg/m3)&quot; ## [2,] &quot;WHO.Region&quot; &quot;PM25.temporal.coverage.(%)&quot; ## [3,] &quot;WHO.Region&quot; &quot;Number.and.type.of.monitoring.stations&quot; ## [4,] &quot;WHO.Region&quot; &quot;Status&quot; ## [5,] &quot;PM2.5.(μg/m3)&quot; &quot;Status&quot; ## [6,] &quot;PM10.(μg/m3)&quot; &quot;Status&quot; ## [7,] &quot;NO2.(μg/m3)&quot; &quot;Status&quot; ## [8,] &quot;PM25.temporal.coverage.(%)&quot; &quot;Status&quot; ## [9,] &quot;PM10.temporal.coverage.(%)&quot; &quot;Status&quot; ## [10,] &quot;NO2.temporal.coverage.(%)&quot; &quot;Status&quot; ## [11,] &quot;Reference&quot; &quot;Status&quot; ## [12,] &quot;Number.and.type.of.monitoring.stations&quot; &quot;Status&quot; The air pollution data set from WHO contains many null values, specifically in 7 columns named PM2.5 (μg/m3), PM10 (μg/m3), NO2 (μg/m3), PM25 temporal coverage (%), PM10 temporal coverage (%), NO2 temporal coverage (%), Number and type of monitoring stations. We focus on PM2.5 (μg/m3) values. We drop the rows which are NAs in this column. Since we compute the average for each country, dropping null values has little impact on our results. "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Examine the GDP of the project countries from 1970 to 2021 4.2 Population of the project countries from 1970 to 2021 4.3 Air Pollution from 2021 to 2021 4.4 Carbon dioxide concentrations from 1958 to 2022 4.5 The temperature change of the project countries from 1961 to 2021 4.6 The mean sea level change of 24 regions from 1992 to 2021 4.7 Changes in greenhouse gas concentrations of the project countries from 1990 to 2019 4.8 Changes in the forest area of the project countries from 1990 to 2019 4.9 Changes in the agricultural area of the project countries from 1990 to 2019 4.10 What is the relationship between the GDP and temperature change of a country? 4.11 What is the relationship between the population and the temperature change of a country? 4.12 What is the relationship between mean sea level change and the sea ice concentration of the world?", " Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Examine the GDP of the project countries from 1970 to 2021 From the GDP dataset, we found that the top ten countries which have the highest GDP in 2021 (in USD, current prices, current PPPs) are: USA, India, Japan, Germany, Indonesia, France, Brazil, UK, Italy, Mexico. The dataset doesn’t contain China’s GDP value in 2021 (but does contain from 1970-2020); this is not reflected as a null value in the dataset. Since China’s GDP is also among the highest in the world before, we decided to include 11 countries: USA, India, Japan, Germany, Indonesia, France, Brazil, UK, Italy, Mexico, and China in our future analysis. From the plot, we can see that China and US’s GDP are much higher than other countries from 2010 to present. China’s GDP is relatively low before 1990, but it grows rapidly and exceeds US’s GDP from 2017 until present. India’s GDP is also growing rapidly in recent years. Other countries’ GDP are growing steadily. 4.2 Population of the project countries from 1970 to 2021 China and India are the top 2 countries which have highest population and population growth rate from 1970 to 2021. China has about 1.42 billion people and India has 1.41 billion in 2021. US, Indonesia, and Brazil ranks the 3rd, 4th, and 5th by population. Other countries’ population grows steadily. 4.3 Air Pollution from 2021 to 2021 There is a jump in India’s PM2.5 concentration before and after 2017, and the data is missing before 2016. It is reasonable that the data are inconsistent since the dataset is combined from two datasets. The data from other countries are consistent. From the IQAir website, the PM2.5 concentration from 0-5 μg/m3 meets WHO guidelines. We can see that China is the most polluted country before 2017, but the air pollution index continues decreasing and in 2021, China’s PM2.5 index is 32.6 μg/m3. India and Indonesia are the top 2 most polluted countries in 2021, with PM2.5 concentration 58.1 and 34.3 μg/m3. Other countries have relatively low air pollution. Our analysis of this graph focus on the impact of Covid-19 on air pollution. Since during the pandemic, there are less outside activities. We compare the data before and after 2019 and see if there is a decreasing trend after Covid-19, as we expected. China and Indonesia’s air pollution value decrease rapidly; Brazil, Italy, Japan, and Mexico have a slight decrease; France, Germany, UK are steady; India and US’s air pollution value increase. The trend and the impact of Covid-19 are different for each country. Air pollution values are affected by multiple factors. 4.4 Carbon dioxide concentrations from 1958 to 2022 One of the most indicative measurements to showcase Earth’s gradually changing climate is the concentration of carbon dioxide (taken at Mauna Loa, Hawaii). Since 1958, Mauna Loa was chosen as a long term monitoring site, due to its lack of vegetation and remote location far from other continents. As shown in the graphs above, the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere has increased from around 313 parts per million in 1958 to over 420 parts per million in 2022. This increase can be attributed to the release of fossil fuels in the atmosphere, which has accelerated since the industrial revolution, and is one of contributors to global warming. In addition to the general pattern of increase exhibited by the graph on the left, the graph on the right displays the seasonality of carbon dioxide data. This curve (known as the Keeling Curve) shows a cyclic variation of about 6 ppm each calendar year, with a peak in May and a minimum in September. The variation is due to the uptake of carbon dioxide by the world’s land vegetation; from the maximum in May, the concentration decreases as new plant growth during Northern hemisphere’s spring and summer absorbs carbon dioxide through Photosynthesis. This set of graphs also allows us to preface the analysis of this project - since climate data is inherently “noisy” and oftentimes seasonal, it is important to keep that in mind as you read through the document, as some patterns or conclusions may not be as definitive as we would have liked. Nonetheless, we do hope that this project serves it educational purpose on the factors that may affect climate change. 4.5 The temperature change of the project countries from 1961 to 2021 In recent years, the world has seen a significant increase in temperature change. This trend is largely attributed to human activity and the resulting increase in greenhouse gas emissions. These emissions trap heat in the atmosphere, leading to a phenomenon known as global warming .From the first time series line/dot plot, we see that although there are some expected seasonal trends year to year, all 11 of the countries undoubtedly increased in temperature change in 2021, compared to 1960. This is certainly an indication that change needs to happen. Thus, it is important that actions are taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the effects of global warming. This may include reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, increasing the use of renewable energy sources, and adopting more sustainable practices in our daily lives. The second plot is a boxplot representation of the same data, where each of the boxplots represents the time series data for that particular country. One important feature to note about all of these boxplots is that the median are all above 0, which corroborates the trend observed in the previous time series plot. In conclusion, the combination of both of these plots shows the undeniable truth that Earth’s atmosphere is gradually heating up, and is yet another indication of climate change. 4.6 The mean sea level change of 24 regions from 1992 to 2021 Rising sea levels are one of the most significant impacts of global warming. As the temperature of the Earth increases, the oceans absorb a large amount of the excess heat, leading to the thermal expansion of seawater. This causes the volume of the oceans to increase, leading to a rise in sea levels. In addition, the melting of glaciers and ice caps, particularly in polar regions, also contributes to the rise in sea levels (a relationship we will revisit soon in this project). Looking at the first time series plot, it can be observed that from 1991 to 2021, there is an increase in sea level change in all of the regions represented above (including the “world” measurement as a whole). There are certainly noise and seasonality in the data, a very clear increase can be observed. 4.7 Changes in greenhouse gas concentrations of the project countries from 1990 to 2019 Since the 20th century, the greenhouse gases produced by human activity have been the major cause of climate change. The excess of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere would disrupt the earth’s carbon cycle and also hasten global warming. These 11 countries account for around 60% of global greenhouse gas emissions, whereas the 100 lowest emitters only contributed about 3%. From this plot, we can see that the greenhouse gas emissions from China and United States are much higher than other countries, and China had a huge jump throughout these years while other countries remain steadily. We know that the majority of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions comes from transportation, electricity generation, agriculture and other forms of energy use. United States is the word’s largest economy throughout years. This results in the greenhouse gas emissions of United States is higher than other developed and developing countries from 1990-2019 but within a relatively steady range. On the other hand, the greenhouse gas emissions from China keeps increasing and reaches the highest level in 2019. This increase can be attributed to the economy development happened in China. China’s economy has grown to one of the largest and most powerful in the world over the past few decades. The extraordinary urbanization boom in China has accelerated greenhouse gas emissions. Cement and steel production, which have fueled China’s infrastructure development, both emit significant amounts of CO2 during the refining process. From the graph above, we can see that most developed countries are decreasing their greenhouse gas emission, while developing countries tends to have a continuous increasing. There are two unusual behaviors in Brazil and Japan. In 2010, the greenhouse gas emmision of Brazil has a sharp drop. The greenhouse gas emission of Japan has dropped from 2007 and reached the lowest in 2009. After 2009, it has a rapid increasing until 2013. This can be attributed to the economy crisis happened in 2008 and 2009. During that period of time, the Japanese economy shrunk and the Tokyo stock market crashed. The GDP of Japan only grew around 1%. Due to the economy crisis, the greenhouse gas emission of Japan dropped hard. 4.8 Changes in the forest area of the project countries from 1990 to 2019 4.9 Changes in the agricultural area of the project countries from 1990 to 2019 From our analysis to greenhouse gases, in 2010, the greenhouse gas emission of Brazil has a sharp drop. This may attribute to the changes in forest land and agricultural area in Brazil. Brazil has the world’s largest remaining tropical forest, accounting for roughly one-third of all remaining rain forests. The major sources of Brazil’s greenhouse gas emission are land-use change and the agriculture. From the graph of changes in forest area, we can tell that from 2010, the rate of deforestation in Brazil has continued to fall However, even thought Brazil succeed in reducing deforestation, the emissions from agriculture and other industries are rising. Based on the graph of changes in agricultural area, we see that land used for agriculture is increasing a lot. This might attribute to the continuous increasing in greenhouse gases after the sharp drop. Besides, based on the two graphs above, we can tell that afforestation is talking place in most countries to balance their greenhouse emissions. 4.10 What is the relationship between the GDP and temperature change of a country? The graphs above were generated by merging the temperature change data set with the GDP data set, each of the data points represents the pair of values (GDP, temperature change) of each country associated with a given year. Before even conducting the analysis, logic informs us that there should be a positive relationship between the GDP and mean temperature change of a country, since a higher GDP typically relates to more production power, more technological advancements, more fossil fuel burning, and a higher output of global warming inducing gases. However, on the other hand, one could make an argument that countries with a higher GDP have better resources for combating and mitigating temperature regulation. Referring back to the individual GDP analysis above, China and the United State’s GDP are magnitudes higher than the other countries’, therefore, to make the graph readable, a scale of “free_x” was used. The resulting faceted graph shows quite a clear relationship between GDP and temperature: as the GDP of a country increases, the mean temperature change also increases. This aligns with the initial logic outlined above. Furthermore, while some countries’ (Brazil and Indonesia) may not exhibit a high slope like the others (France, Italy, US), there is still a relatively strong positive relationship. Therefore, with a degree of confidence, our group concludes that there is a positive correlation between the GDP and temperature change of a country (exhibited with the data we collected, cleaned, and transformed). However, like I prefaced in the beginning of this project, climate data is inherently noisy, and incredibly dynamic; so it is entirely possible we may have missed some confounding variable that is contributing to this correlation. 4.11 What is the relationship between the population and the temperature change of a country? Similar with the temperature change v.s GDP plot above, this graph was also generated by merging the respective data sets. Each of the data points from the faceted graph above represents the pair of values (population, temperature change) of each country associated with a given year. Before even conducting the analysis, we hypothesized that there would be a positive relationship between the population and the temperature change of a country. This initial guess aligns perfectly well with logic, now let us see if our data supports this. Referring back to the individual population analysis above, it can be observed that China and India have populations that are magnitudes higher than all of the other countries, so again, in order to make our graphs readable, a scale of “free_x” is used. The resulting faceted graph shows quite a clear positive relationship for all 11 of the countries. One can even make an argument that the correlation is stronger in this graph than the previous one of GDP v.s temperature change. Our gathered data and analysis supports the conclusion that there is a semi-strong positive correlation between the population and the temperature change of a country. 4.12 What is the relationship between mean sea level change and the sea ice concentration of the world? As we have mentioned earlier in this project, the relationship of sea ice volume and sea level change will be explored. The relationship between sea level change and sea ice volume is complex and not fully understood; however, one factor that is known to play a role is the melting of glaciers and ice caps, which can contribute to a rise in sea levels. As sea ice melts, it adds more water to the oceans, which can cause sea levels to rise. From the first pair of plots, we are able to observe an increase in the sea level change, while during the same time frame, the sea ice volume is decreasing. Therefore, to observe the trend further, we created a scatterplot of these values merged together on the same year. From the scatterplot, there is clear negative correlation between these two features (we will never conclude causality), as sea ice volume decreases, the sea level rises. The extent that sea ice actually contributes to sea level rise is extremely difficult to quantify, as the climate system is so dynamic. But nevertheless, from these graphs, a clear relationship can be observed. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 5 Interactive component", " Chapter 5 Interactive component The link to our interactive graph: https://vizhub.com/BrownSugarBobaMilkTea/32d26753eb734ba982fad98ec14e0b13?edit=files&amp;file=index.js Our interactive component consists of the representation of greenhouse gas (GHG) concentration of the top 11 GDP countries of the world (the same countries we have been using throughout the project). Our group felt that GHGs are a good representation of Earth’s climate change, as they are an integral component of Earth’s greenhouse effect, which is a major source of global warming. The interactive graph is a horizontal barchart, allowing the user to hover over each country’s bar, and observe the exact greenhouse gas concentration for that year. This final product is quite simple, but we believe it is extremely useful. Since the ability to see the exact number (rather than inferring an approximation from a graph) is a valuable feature to have for any type of analysis. Our group was quite ambitious in the interactive component we wanted to produce; however, ultimately it was too difficult to execute and we had to settle upon something that was manageable, but at the same time still providing extra value. Initially, we wanted the graph to be in the form of a world map, where the user can hover over each country, ocean, or sea, and observe the GDP, population, carbon dioxide, pollution, GHG, and all other features discussed in our project. The user would also have the ability to vary the years and observe all of the features throughout time. Given more time and experience, this is definitely a product we want to explore in the future. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusion", " Chapter 6 Conclusion The central topic of our project is climate change, an immensely important, complicated, and dynamic field that has implications in almost every aspect of the human world. And while we certainly did not provide a comprehensive analysis of all of the factors that contributes/relates to climate change, we did make an attempt at a subset of those features. Throughout this project, we explored 12 different questions (ranging from the analysis of a country’s GDP to the relationship between sea level change and sea ice volume). Some of our main takeaways are as follows. At a very high level, the GDP, population, air pollution, carbon dioxide concentrations, temperature change, mean sea level change, greenhouse gas concentrations, forest area, and agricultural area of the top 11 GDP countries have all seen significant changes over the past several decades. These changes can be attributed to a variety of factors, including but not limited to human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels and natural processes such as the inherent seasonality of climate data. Additionally, there are complex relationships between these different features, such as the relationship between GDP and temperature change, population and temperature change, and sea level change and sea ice concentration. These complex relationship individually can warrant years of research to fully understand and develop, therefore, we have only provided a brief introduction/analysis to these questions. Despite the relative simplicity of our research compared to those in academia, we certainly hope that this project gave the you (the audience) an indication of how our beloved Earth is changing (mostly for the worse), and that steps are needed to ensure the survival of this blue, beautiful, and unique planet. There are several limitations not just to our project, but to the study of climate change as whole. One of the major challenges is the complexity of the Earth’s climate system, which is influenced by a wide range of factors including atmospheric conditions, ocean currents, and human activity. As a result, it can be difficult to predict how the climate will change in the future, and the exact impacts of these changes are often difficult to quantify. Another limitation is the limited availability of long-term data on the climate, which makes it difficult to accurately assess historical trends and patterns. Additionally, the study of climate change often involves complex mathematical models and computer simulations, which can be subject to errors and uncertainties. Finally, with this only being a semester in length, there was not an abundance of time for our group to explore all of the complex climate models or uncertainties in climate observations, therefore, our exploration is admittedly focused more on breadth, rather than depth. Due to these limitations, there are a plethora of potential future directions that this project can take. For example, our group wanted to include a variety of different plots (other than just time series and boxplots) to represent the climate data. Therefore, one potential future step is to transform and translate the data (in a proper and climate approved manner) in order to explore other medians of representation. Furthermore, with climate data being so inherently noisy and u=subjected to errors, in the future, we could potentially consult climate research to learn how to deal with this type of data, rather than just simply discarding or imputing missing values. In conclusion, this project was an immense learning experience for our group, not just for climate change, but about the techniques of exploratory data analysis and visualization as well. One recurring realization and lesson that seems to be present everywhere in the field of data science is that 80% of the work will be cleaning and transforming data. This was most definitely the case in our project, as the process to join different data sets on the common fields of countries and years required quite a bit of transformation. Nonetheless, as group, we are proud of the work we put into this project, and we hope the audience learned something new/interesting about climate change. Thank you!
